			<p>
				Users may browse our website as a guest, but may have limited access to certain features. For instance, guests cannot participate in our game, forums, or personal messaging system. We do not allow guests to participate in said features due to the possiblity of them sharing personally identifyable information either about themselves or others without the proper record of tracking on our website.

				In order to participate in the above features, users will need to sign up to BLOX City using an email, username, and password. Emails are not shared with third-parties. For security we ask that users create a username that does not reflect any personal information about them. We also ask that our users choose a password that is not easily guessable. All passwords are stored in an encrypted form and are not accessible by anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you sign up to BLOX City, we will ask for your email address. This email address must be a valid email address. The reason we ask for a valid email is for both account verification and support requests.
