Since our launch on March 6th, 2016 we have continuously tried to find our way. BLOX City was founded to be the next-generation of user-generated sandboxes. Our hopes are to build a strong, user-first platform that treats developers and players alike. We want to help the next generation into a field of unlimited potential. That is BLOX City's mission: to let your creativity flow. Because with creativity, comes imagination. And with imagination, comes the future.
